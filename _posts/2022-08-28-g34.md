This appeared in Marlin via [Prusa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqH41K2vq0g&t=300s) as `M45 Z` and then in marlin as [M915](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M915.html) before becoming an option for [G34](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/G034-mgc.html). The better known [G34 that uses a probe](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/G034-zsaa.html) is equivalent to [Z_TILT_ADJUST](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html#z_tilt_adjust) in Klipper.

I made a very slow [video showing the marlin version in operation on my Ender 3](https://youtu.be/CWfAdz4vtpY) on my SKR mini board.

I implemented [MECHANICAL_GANTRY_ALIGN as a Klipper macro](https://github.com/strayr/strayr-k-macros/blob/main/mechanical_level_tmc2209.cfg) almost immediately after getting klipper running on my SKR mini.

I still use this on my Prusa style printer, despite it having a driver for both stepper motors. If I disturb the adjustable bed, I use this to set the gantry parallel to the top of the frame as a reference before running [SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html#screws_tilt_calculate) ([G35 in marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/G035.html), use it) to set the plane through the 4 corners of the bed to be parallel to the Y axis and the level taken from the frame top. However in my START_PRINT routine i use Z_TILT_ADJUST because the bed doesn't go out of tram once set up unless something really bad happens.

This requires TMC drivers to be set up ([using UART or SPI](https://www.klipper3d.org/TMC_Drivers.html)) to allow software control of the stepper current. Without that, or if you use too high a current it may break your printer. This does **not** use [STALLGUARD](https://www.trinamic.com/technology/motor-control-technology/stallguard-and-coolstep/) or sensorless homing.
