As of today I am removing my files from Thingiverse and replacing them with links of where to find them on my github.

Why? [Thingiverse requires me to disable Firefox's tracking protection.](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/sy4hvw/thingiverse_now_doesnt_allow_download_if_i_have/). I find this really intrusive. I don't have a problem with being shown ads. They gotta pay the bills. I'm not handing over my privacy because they can't tell the difference between adblockers and tracking protection.

Most things i have done are all bundled into [small-fff-projects](https://github.com/strayr/small-fff-projects), and I'm going to try to use PrusaPrinters and maybe Thangs more, but I'm keeping and linking back to github as my most recent versions.
