## Hello World

Yes. You. I'm waving at you.

Apparently i felt the need for a page to waffle about my codespace

It's ~~basic~~ minimal

## Check out my ~~nerdy~~ cool stuff:

- I made [strayr-k-macros](https://github.com/strayr/strayr-k-macros) to make the 3D printer firmware [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) a bit more comfortable. It's spaghetti.

- I have some Voron conversion ongong, with a [toolhead/extruder carriage](https://github.com/strayr/voron-afterburner-ender3) for the ender 3 and some fixes for a full conversion
